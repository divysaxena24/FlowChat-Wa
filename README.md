## 💡 Design Philosophy

The UI components such as the Navbar, Hero Section, Feature Cards, and Footer were initially scaffolded using Vercel v0, which generated the base layout and Tailwind CSS structure. v0 helped create responsive sections quickly, including grid layouts, spacing, and component wrappers. The primary styling, transitions, and interactive logic (like mobile menu toggles) were later refined manually. While Vercel v0 accelerated the starting point of the design, additional customization, animations, and component logic were hand-written to achieve the final polished look.
